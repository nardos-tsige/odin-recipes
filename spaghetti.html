    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Italian pasta dish comes from Rome and is made with <em>eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper</em>. It's creamy, rich, and incredibly satisfying.</p>
    <p>The key to perfect carbonara is tossing the hot pasta with the egg mixture off the heat to create a silky sauce without scrambling the eggs.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>8 ounces pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti according to package directions.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, fry pancetta in a large skillet until crispy. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk eggs, cheese, and plenty of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
        <li>Quickly toss hot pasta with pancetta, then add egg mixture and toss rapidly. Add pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra cheese and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
